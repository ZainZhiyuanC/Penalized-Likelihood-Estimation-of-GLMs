# Penalized-Likelihood-Estimation-of-GLMs

Penalized likelihood estimation for generalized linear models (GLMs) is introduced. First, the maximum likelihood estimation of the GLM and the algorithm for solving it by Newton's method are derived, then two algorithms for solving the penalized likelihood estimation by LQA and MM are presented, and finally the new algorithm is generated by combining the two. The mathematical derivation and the algorithm are given.

For data from different covariance matrices, the SCAD estimates of both Logistic and Poisson regressions were calculated. The high-dimensional case has not yet been simulated because the I don't know how to give a good initial estimate in high dimensions and wish for further guide and communication.

Penalized Likelihood Estimation of GLMs.pdf is written in chinese. glmCourse_UWarwick.pdf is reference of GLM from the University of Warwick. Three high_dimen_funcs R files are the codes of estimation and simulation functions.

介绍了广义线性模型（GLM）的惩罚似然估计。首先推导了GLM的极大似然估计以及用牛顿法求解的算法，然后归纳了LQA和MM两种求解惩罚似然估计的算法，最后将二者结合得到新算法。给出了数学推导和算法。

对于来自不同协方差矩阵的数据，求解了Logistic和Poisson回归的SCAD估计。高维情况尚未模拟，因为笔者不知道高维下如何给出一个好的初始估计，希望有朋友指点。

报告PDF是用中文写成的（Penalized Likelihood Estimation of GLMs），glmCourse_UWarwick是来自华威大学的GLM参考资料，三个high_dimen_funcs是所有的估计和模拟函数代码。
